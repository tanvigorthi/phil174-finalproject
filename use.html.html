<span class="s0">&lt;h3&gt; </span><span class="s1">Using The Model</span><span class="s0">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;   </span><span class="s1">We will conduct experiments and case studies to evaluate the environmental impact of training LLMs on smaller datasets. These studies will measure energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and performance metrics to determine the feasibility and benefits of using smaller datasets. By assessing whether smaller datasets can achieve acceptable performance levels while reducing emissions, we can promote the adoption of more sustainable AI practices. This assessment will provide a basis for recommending smaller, more efficient datasets in LLM training. Additionally, during analysis and deployment, we utilize bias audits and performance metrics to ensure the model works as it should. Smaller datasets should not result in less effective models, and these steps help to calibrate the algorithms to your needs. </span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;  </span><span class="s1">The collected data can then be used to develop guidelines and best practices for environmentally sustainable AI development within your business. These recommendations will cover optimal dataset sizes, energy-efficient hardware choices, and sustainable data center operations. Enabling you to make informed decisions that balance AI performance with environmental sustainability will foster a culture of responsible and sustainable AI development, contributing positively to both technological innovation and environmental stewardship.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;h3&gt; </span><span class="s1">Appropriate Use Cases </span><span class="s0">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s1">The model is suitable for datasets that can suitably be trained on smaller datasets: this often ends up being large language models where case-sensitive accuracy is not crucial, and reducing one’s carbon footprint becomes a primary goal. Consider the use of the model to train a math solver, in which a student inputs a math problem, and gets a thorough explanation of the answer and how the answer was reached. In this sort of model, it is unnecessary to have repetitive case-specific data. The model can be trained on a few mathematical problems and it can then build upon that knowledge to give better answers. </span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s1">The model is unsuitable for datasets that must be considered on a case-by-case basis. It should not be used, for example, in healthcare, where it is crucial to have patient-specific data: context, family history, previous illnesses, regardless of how a previous patient’s history may have contributed to their pattern of health. In that case, the model must consider every possible outcome on a case-by-case basis, and data minimization would defeat the purpose of an effective model. High-risk scenarios, like autonomous vehicles, may also be unsuitable for such data minimization models: it is more appropriate to prioritize goals other than sustainability, like safety and health.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;h3&gt; </span><span class="s1">Interpreting The Model's Outputs</span><span class="s0">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s1">The model’s outputs should be interpreted based on the context and specific application needs. For instance, in educational tools, the focus should be on the overall learning outcomes and whether the model provides accurate and useful explanations. In general language models, outputs should be examined for coherence, relevance, and reduction in carbon footprint. Regular audits and reviews are essential to ensure the model's performance aligns with its intended goals. For sensitive applications, such as healthcare, each output should be evaluated for accuracy and completeness, ensuring that the data minimization process does not compromise the quality of information provided.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;h3&gt; </span><span class="s1">Improving Fairness and Justice Using Our Model</span><span class="s0">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; </span><span class="s1">Environmental Justice</span><span class="s0">&lt;/i&gt;</span><span class="s1">: By reducing the carbon footprint of data centers, the model contributes to environmental sustainability, benefiting communities affected by pollution and climate change. This aligns with broader goals of environmental justice, ensuring that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately impacted by the environmental consequences of large-scale data operations. It aims to lessen the impact of data centers on the power grids. In this model, we take a closer look at data minimization and use.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; </span><span class="s1">Equitable Access To Resources:</span><span class="s0">&lt;/i&gt; </span><span class="s1">Optimizing data storage and processing efficiency can lower costs for organizations, making advanced AI technologies more accessible to smaller institutions and developing regions. This promotes equitable access to resources and technology, bridging the gap between resource-rich and resource-poor communities, as well as helping bridge the North-South divide. Additionally, through lessening the impacts on power grids, it can ensure that in places that have housing, as well as data centers, the grid can cater to  people as they need.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;h3&gt; </span><span class="s1">When Should the Model Be Updated/ Revised? </span><span class="s0">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;</span><span class="s1">Emerging Environmental Data:</span><span class="s0">&lt;/b&gt; </span><span class="s1">The model will need to be updated when new data on environmental impact or technological advancements (e.g., renewable energy use in data centers) become available.</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;</span><span class="s1">Changing Energy Usage:</span><span class="s0">&lt;/b&gt; </span><span class="s1">The model will need to be updated when energy usage of the data center points to performance failure: consider all performance metrics to ensure data minimization is being performed as needed, or calibrate accordingly.</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;</span><span class="s1">Changing Ethical Standards:</span><span class="s0">&lt;/b&gt; </span><span class="s1">The model will need to be revised if ethical standards evolve, such as new regulations on data privacy or updated principles in global equity and sustainability.</span>
